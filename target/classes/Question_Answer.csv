Hi!;  You can try to make a natural hot oil treatment for your hair. Hot oil treatments are used to help with scalp and hair health and growth. You'll need a hot oil of your choice, such as coconut oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, or olive oil. Start by heating the oil in a microwave-safe bowl or double boiler until it is warm and not hot. Once the oil is warm, apply it to your scalp, massaging it in with your fingertips. Work your way down the length of your hair and massage the oil in. Once your hair is covered in oil, allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes, then rinse it out with a mild shampoo. You can do this hot oil treatment once or twice a month for best results.
